# Description
The platform not only offers a comprehensive range of fitness services but also enhances usability by incorporating features such as coach booking and fitness check-ins. It mainly encompasses three roles: members, coaches, and administrators. Both members and coaches have the ability to modify their personal information and book training sessions. Administrators, on the other hand, have the capability to manage the information of both members and coaches, as well as oversee the gym's operations.
